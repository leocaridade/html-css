         <h3>Here's a time line of Frida Kahlo's life:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Jul 6, 1907</strong> - Born in Coyoacan, Mexico. Her father, Wilhelm Kahlo (who changed his name to Guillermo Kahlo) was a German Jewish photographer; her mather, Matilde Calderon, a Catholic mestiza, or woman of mixed European and Indian ancestry. Frida was one of 5 children born into the marriage.</li>
        <li><strong>Oct 22, 1913</strong> - At age 6, Frida was struck with polio affecting the use of her right leg. Her leg grew very thin, and her foot was stunted in its growth. During her nine month convalescence, her father made sure that she regularly exercised the muscles in her leg and foot. Despite their efforts, her leg and foot remained deformed.</li>
        <li><strong>Aug 1, 1922</strong> - Frida commutes to Mexico City to begin classes at the National Preparatory School. Frida is one of only 35 girls to attend the prestigious school with hopes of becoming a doctor. At this point in her life she has no interest in pursuing a career as an artist.</li>
        <li><strong>Sep 17, 1925</strong> - She was severely injured in a bus accident. Her injuries included a broken spinal column, collarbone, pelvis, and more. Though she recovered from the injuries and eventually regained her ability to walk, she remained in extreme pain for the rest of her life.</li>
        <li><strong>1926</strong> - During her months of convalescence from the bus accident she begins to take painting seriously. In September Frida paints "Self-Portrait in a Velvet Dress", her first serious work and the first of many self-portraits to come. She paints it as a gift for her boyfriend, Alejandro Gómez Arias.</li>
        <li><strong>1928</strong> - Kahlo joined the Mexican Communist Party, only to be expelled one year later, with Rivera, for opposing Stalin's crackdown on Trotsky's Left Opposition. Although later reconciling herself to Stalinism, Kahlo remained on the left and always considered herself a communist.</li>
        <li><strong>Aug 21, 1929</strong> - Frida Kahlo married Diego Rivera in a civil ceremony in the townhall of Coyoacán. Diego was 42 years old, 6' 1" tall and 300 pounds; Frida was 22, 5'3" and just 98 pounds. Frida's mother did not approve of the union and did not attend the wedding ceremony. Frida's father was less resistant to the marriage and attended the ceremony.</li>
        <li><strong>Nov 10, 1930</strong> - Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera move to San Francisco</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - While in San Francisco, Frida painted "Frieda and Diego Rivera", a folkloric style double-portrait that may have been based on a wedding photograph. The painting, shown at the "Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists", was the first public showing of her work.</li>
        <li><strong>Dec 20, 1933</strong> - Frida and Diego return to Mexico. Upon their return they move into the double studio-houses in San Angel designed for them by Juan O'Gorman.</li>
        <li><strong>Nov 1, 1938 to Nov 15, 1938</strong> - Frida traveled to New York for her first one-person exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery. Frida was reluctant to go but Rivera encouraged her by saying it would be good for her art career.</li>
        <li><strong>Nov 6, 1939</strong> - Diego Riveras divorces Frida Kahlo. The periods before and after their separation were among Kahlo's most difficult and most productive.</li>
        <li><strong>Dec 8, 1940</strong> - Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo Remarry</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - She began keeping a diary to document her emotional feelings in text and drawings. She continued to make entries in the diary until her death ten years later. This diary would later become the key to better understanding the woman and her art.</li>
        <li><strong>Jul 13, 1954</strong> - Frida Kahlo dies</li>
        </ul>
